# Smart Phone contract #

The goal of this smart contract is to create a decentralized phone contract between two parties : the phone company and a customer.

In the first instance, the customer makes a guarantee deposit.
Then he can use a function to pay his contract and another to break his contract.
The operator can use a function to collect the phone plan, a function to break the contract and collect the deposit if the amount due reaches 90% (variable) of the deposit.
